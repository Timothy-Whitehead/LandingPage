# Timothy Whitehead: Software Developer

## About Me

I am an intelligent and enthusiastic indidual, with a passion for programming. 
I have been interested in coding for many years and have recently taken the plunge into
learning how to create apps and web pages. I have recently completed a DfE funded Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp course  
and I have completed many projects, some of which I will be uploading to GitHub.
I have also begun to study independently in order to expand on my knowledge and skillset. 
Looking into learning new coding languages and new uses and applications for what I have learnt.  
I am hoping to launch a new career in Software Development based on my studies and looking 
forward to using my skills in a professional capacity.
